This project was developed by [@fronbasal](https://twitter.com/fronbasal/), [@StoneLabs__](https://twitter.com/StoneLabs__) and [@petabyteboy](https://twitter.com/petabyteboy/) for the [OpenCodes 2018](https://opencodes.io/) hackathon and won the "Art & Technology" category. It shines a light on the beauty of abstract art by letting the user choose from a selection of pictures to create an esthetically pleasing result.
